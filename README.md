### Sunshine Of Your Love 
#### Cream

It's getting near dawn \
When lights close their tired eyes \
I'll soon be with you, my love \
To give you my dawn surprise

I'll be with you, darling, soon \
I'll be with you when the stars start falling

I've been waiting so long \
To be where I'm going \
In the sunshine of your love

I'm with you, my love \
The light's shining through on you \
Yes, I'm with you, my love \
It's the morning and just we two
 
I'll stay with you, darling, now \
I'll stay with you 'till my seas are dried up
 
I've been waiting so long \
To be where I'm going \
In the sunshine of your love

(solo)

I'm with you, my love \

### Listen To The Music 
#### Doobie Brothers

Don't you feel it growin', day by day \
People gettin' ready for the news \
Some are happy, some are sad \
Oh, we gotta let the music play

What the people need \
Is a way to make 'em smile \
It ain't so hard to do if you know how \
Gotta get a message \
Get it on through \
Oh, now mama don't you ask me why

Oh, oh, listen to the music \
Oh, oh, listen to the music \
Oh, oh, listen to the music \
All the time

Well I know, you know better \
Everything I say \
Meet me in the country for a day \
We'll be happy \
And we'll dance \
Oh, we're gonna dance our blues away

And if I'm feelin' good to you \
And you're feelin' good to me \
There ain't nothin' we can't do or say \
Feelin' good, feeling fine \
Oh, baby, let the music play

Oh, oh, listen to the music \
Oh, oh, listen to the music \
Oh, oh, listen to the music \
All the time

Like a lazy flowing river \
Surrounding castles in the sky \
And the crowd is growing bigger \
List'nin' for the happy sounds \
And I have to let them fly
 
Oh, oh, listen to the music \
Oh, oh, listen to the music \
Oh, oh, listen to the music \
All the time

Oh, oh, listen to the music \
Oh, oh, listen to the music \
Oh, oh, listen to the music \
All the time

### Behind Blue Eyes 
#### The Who

No one knows what it's like \
To be the bad man \
To be the sad man \
Behind blue eyes
 
No one knows what it's like \
To be hated \
To be fated \
To telling only lies

But my dreams \
They aren't as empty \
As my conscience seems to be \
I have hours, only lonely \
My love is vengeance \
That's never free

No one knows what it's like \
To feel these feelings \
Like I do \
And I blame you

No one bites back as hard \
On their anger \
None of my pain and woe \
Can show through

But my dreams \
They aren't as empty \
As my conscience seems to be \
I have hours, only lonely \
My love is vengeance \
That's never free

When my fist clenches, crack it open \
Before I use it and lose my cool \
When I smile, tell me some bad news \
Before I laugh and act like a fool 

And if I swallow anything evil \
Put your finger down my throat \
And if I shiver, please give me a blanket \
Keep me warm, let me wear your coat

No one knows what it's like \
To be the bad man \
To be the sad man \
Behind blue eyes

### I Hate Myself For Loving You 
#### Joan Jett & the Blackhearts

Midnight gettin' uptight, where are you? \
You said you'd meet me, now it's quarter to two \
I know I'm hangin', but I'm still wantin' you \
Hey, Jack, it's a fact they're talkin' in town \
I turn my back, and you're messin' around \
I'm not really jealous, don't like lookin' like a clown

I think of you every night and day \
You took my heart then you took my pride away

I hate myself for loving you \
Can't break free from the the things that you do \
I wanna walk but I run back to you \
That's why I hate myself for loving you ... Ow, uh

Daylight spent the night without you \
But I've been dreamin' 'bout the lovin' you do \
I'm over being angry 'bout the hell you put me through

Hey man, bet you can treat me right \
You just don't know what you was missin' last night \
I wanna see you begging, say, "Forget it" just for spite

I think of you every night and day \
You took my heart and you took my pride away

I hate myself for loving you \
Can't break free from the things that you do \
I wanna walk but I run back to you \
That's why I hate myself for loving you \
Ow, uh

I think of you every night and day \
You took my heart and you took my pride away

(chamar palmas) \
I hate myself for loving you \
Can't break free from the things that you do \
I wanna walk but I run back to you \
That's why I hate myself for loving you

I hate myself for loving you \
Can't break free from the things that you do \
I wanna walk but I run back to you \
That's why I hate myself for loving you

I hate myself (ow, uh) \
For loving you (alright) \
I hate myself (ow, uh) \
For loving you

I hate myself (ow, ow, ow) \
For loving you \
I hate myself (ow, uh)

I hate myself for loving you

### Because The Night 
#### Patti Smith

Take me now, baby, here as I am \
Pull me close, try and understand \
Desire is hunger is the fire I breathe \
Love is a banquet on which we feed

Come on now, try and understand \
The way I feel when I'm in your hand \
Take my hand, come undercover \
They can't hurt you now \
Can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now

Because the night belongs to lovers \
Because the night belongs to lust \
Because the night belongs to lovers \
Because the night belongs to us

Have I doubt when I am alone \
Love is a ring, the telephone \
Love is an angel disguised as lust \
Here in our bed until the morning comes

Come on now, try and understand \
The way I feel under your command \
Take my hands, as the sun descends \
They can't touch you now \
Can't touch you now, can't touch you now

Because the night belongs to lovers \
Because the night belongs to lust \
Because the night belongs to lovers \
Because the night belongs to us

(solo)

With love we sleep \
With doubt the vicious circle \
Turns and burns \
Without you I cannot live \
Forgive the yearning burning \
I believe it's time, too real to feel \
So touch me now, touch me now, touch me now

Because the night belongs to lovers \
Because the night belongs to lust \
Because the night belongs to lovers \
Because the night belongs to us

Because tonight, there are two lovers \
If we believe in the night we trust \
Because the night belongs to lovers \
Because the night belongs to love

Because the night \
Belongs to lovers \
Because the night \
Belongs to love

'Cause we believe tonight we're lovers \
'Cause we believe, in the night we trust \
Because the night belongs to lovers

### Jumpin' Jack Flash 
#### The Rolling Stones

I was born in a crossfire hurricane \
And I howled at my ma in the driving rain \
But it's all right, now, in fact it's a gas \
But it's all right, I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash \
It's a gas, gas, gas!

I was raised by a toothless, bearded hag \
I was schooled with a strap right across my back \
But it's all right, now, in fact it's a gas \
But it's all right, I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash \
It's a gas, gas, gas!

(solo)

I was drowned, I was washed up and left for dead \
I fell down to my feet and I saw they bled (yeah) \
Show them how to frown at the crumbs of a crust of bread (show them) \
Yeah, I was crowned with a spike right through my head

But it's all right, now, in fact it's a gas \
But it's all right, I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash \
It's a gas, gas, gas!

Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas \
Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas \
Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas \
Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas

Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas \
Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas

### Whiskey In The Jar 
#### Metallica

As I was goin' over the Cork and Kerry mountains \
I saw Captain Farrell and his money, he was countin' \
I first produced my pistol and then produced my rapier \
I said: Stand and deliver, oh, or the devil, he may take ya

I took all of his money and it was a pretty penny \
I took all of his money, yeah, and I brought it home to Molly \
She swore that she'd love me, no, never would she leave me \
But the devil take that woman, yeah, for you know she tricked me easy

Musha ring, dum-a-doo dum-a-da \
Whack for my daddy-o \
Whack for my daddy-o \
There's whiskey in the jar-o

Being drunk and weary, I went to Molly's chamber \
Takin' money with me, but I never knew the danger \
For about six, or maybe seven, in walked Captain Farrell \
I jumped up, fired my pistols and I shot him with both barrels

Musha ring, dum-a-doo dum-a-da \
Whack for my daddy-o \
Whack for my daddy-o \
There's whiskey in the jar-o \
Yeah, yeah, whiskey in the jar-o

Now, some men like fishin' and some men like the fowlin' \
And some men like to hear, to hear the cannon ball a-roarin' \
Me, I like sleepin', especially in my Molly's chamber \
But here I am, in prison, here I am with a ball and chain, yeah

Musha ring, dum-a-doo dum-a-da \
Whack for my daddy-o \
Whack for my daddy-o \
There's whiskey in the jar-o

Musha ring, dum-a-doo dum-a-da \
Musha ring, dum-a-doo dum-a-da \
Musha ring, dum-a-doo dum-a-da \
Musha ring, dum-a-doo dum-a-da

### Zombie
#### The Cranberries

Another head hangs lowly \
Child is slowly taken \
And the violence caused such silence \
Who are we mistaken?

But you see, it's not me \
It's not my family \
In your head, in your head, they are fighting \
With their tanks and their bombs \
And their bombs, and their guns \
In your head, in your head they are crying

In your head, in your head \
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie \
What's in your head, in your head \
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh

Du, du, du, du \
Du, du, du, du \
Du, du, du, du \
Du, du, du, du 

Another mother's breaking heart is taking over \
When the violence causes silence \
We must be mistaken

It's the same old theme \
Since nineteen-sixteen \
In your head, in your head, they're still fighting \
With their tanks and their bombs \
And their bombs, and their guns \
In your head, in your head, they are dying

In your head, in your head \
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie \
What's in your head, in your head \
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, eh-eh oh, ya-ya

### What's Up?
#### 4 Non Blondes

Twenty-five years \
And my life is still \
I'm trying to get up \
That great big hill of hope \
For a destination

I realized quickly \
When I knew I should \
That the world was made up \
For this brotherhood of man \
For whatever that means

And so I cry sometimes \
When I'm lying in bed \
Just to get it all out \
What's in my head \
And I, I am feeling \
A little peculiar

And so I wake in the morning \
And thenn I step outside \
And I take a deep breath \
And I get real high \
And I \
Scream from the top of my lungs \
What's going on?

And I say, hey, yeah, yeah-eah \
Hey, yeah, yeah \
I said, hey! What's goin' on?

And I sing, hey, yeah, yeah-eah \
Hey, yeah, yeah \
I said, hey! What's going on?

And I try, oh, my God, do I try \
I try all the time \
In this institution

And I pray, oh, my God, do I pray \
I pray every single day \
For a revolution

And so I cry sometimes \
When I'm lying in bed \
Just to get it all out \
What's in my head \
And I, I am feeling \
A little peculiar

And so I wake in the morning \
And I step outside \
And I take deep breath \
And I get real high \
And I scream from the top of my lungs \
What's going on?

And I say, hey, yeah, yeah-eah \
Hey, yeah, yeah \
I said, hey! What's goin' on?

And I sing, hey, yeah, yeah-eah \
Hey, yeah, yeah \
I said, hey! What's going on?

And I say, hey, yeah, yeah-eah \
Hey, yeah, yeah \
I said, hey! What's goin' on?

And I sing, hey, yeah, yeah-eah \
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah \
I said, hey! What's going on?

Twenty-five years \
And my life is still \

### Perfect Strangers
#### Deep Purple

Can you remember, remember my name? \
As I flow through your life \
A thousand oceans I have flown \
And cold, cold spirits of ice \
All my life, I am the echo of your past \
(echo of your past)

I am returning, the echo of a point in time \
Distant faces shine \
A thousand warriors I have known \
Oh, and laughing, as the spirits appear \
All, all your life, shadows of another day

And if you hear me talking on the wind \
You've got to understand \
We must remain perfect strangers

(I know) \
I know I must remain inside this silent well of sorrow

A strand of silver, hanging through the sky \
Touching more than you see \
The voice of ages in your mind \
Oh, is aching, with the dead of the night \
Oh oh, precious life \
Your tears are lost in falling rain

And if you hear me talking on the wind \
You've got to understand \
We must remain perfect strangers

### Breaking All The Rules
#### Peter Frampton

We are the people one and all \
From deliverance to the fall \
From the battle and the heat \
To our triumph and defeat

We are the young ones crying out \
Full of anger, full of doubt \
And we're breaking all of the rules \
Never choosing to be fools

We are tired of being used \
We are constantly excused \
In the battle and the heat \
In the shadow of retreat

We are the young ones crying out \
Full of anger, full of doubt \
And we're breaking all of the rules \
Never choosing to be fools

(solo)

We are the people one and all \
From deliverance to the fall \
From the bitter to the brave \
From the cradle to the grave

We are the young ones crying out \
Full of anger, full of doubt \
And we're breaking all of the rules \
Never choosing to be fools

### Alive
#### Pearl Jam
 
Son, she said, have I got a little story for you \
What you thought was your daddy was nothing but a– \
While you were sittin' home alone at age thirteen \
Your real daddy was dyin' \
Sorry you didn't see him \

Oh, I, oh I'm still alive \
Hey, I, oh I'm still alive \
Hey, I, oh I'm still alive \
Hey, I, oh I'm still alive \

While she walks slowly across a young man's room \
She said, I'm ready for you \
Why I can't remember anything to this very day \
'Cept the look, the look \
Oh, you know where \

### Stand By Me
#### Ben E. King

When the night has come \
And the land is dark \
And the Moon is the only light we'll see \
No, I won't be afraid \
Oh, I won't be afraid \
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

So, darlin', darlin', stand by me \
Oh, stand by me \
Oh, stand \
Stand by me \
Stand by me

If the sky that we look upon \
Should tumble and fall \
Or the mountains should crumble to the sea \
I won't cry, I won't cry \
No, I won't shed a tear \
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

And, darlin', darlin', stand by me \
Oh, stand by me \
Whoa, stand now \
Stand by me \
Stand by me

Darlin', darlin', stand by me \
Oh, stand by me \
Oh, stand now \
Stand by me \
Stand by me

Whenever you're in trouble, won't you stand by me? \
Oh, stand by me \
Wow, just stand now \
Oh, stand \
Stand by me

### Synchronicity II
#### The Police

Another suburban family morning \
Grandmother screaming at the wall \
We have to shout above the din of our Rice Crispies \
We can't hear anything at all \
Mother chants her litany of boredom and frustration \
But we know all her suicides are fake \
Daddy only stares into the distance \
There's only so much more that he can take

Many miles away \
Something crawls from the slime \
At the bottom of a dark Scottish lake

Another industrial ugly morning \
The factory belches filth into the sky \
He walks unhindered through the picket lines today \
He doesn't think to wonder why

The secretaries pout and preen like \
cheap tarts in a red light street \
But all he ever thinks to do is watch \
And every single meeting with his so-called superior \
Is a humiliating kick in the crotch

Many miles away \
Something crawls to the surface \
Of a dark Scottish loch

Another working day has ended \
Only the rush hour hell to face \
Packed like lemmings into shiny metal boxes \
Contestants in a suicidal race

Daddy grips the wheel and stares alone into the distance \
He knows that something somewhere has to break \
He sees the family home now looming in the headlights \
The pain upstairs that makes his eyeballs ache

Many miles away \
There's a shadow on the door \
Of a cottage on the shore \
Of a dark Scottish lake

Many miles away, many miles away

### Hotel California
#### Eagles

On a dark desert highway \
Cool wind in my hair \
Warm smell of colitas \
Rising up through the air \
Up ahead, in the distance \
I saw a shimmering light \
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim \
I had to stop for the night

There she stood, in the doorway \
I heard the Mission bell \
And I was thinking to myself \
This could be heaven or this could be hell \
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way \
There were voices down the corridor \
I thought I heard them say

Welcome to the Hotel California \
Such a lovely place \
(Such a lovely place) \
Such a lovely face

Plenty of room at the Hotel California \
Any time of year \
(Any time of year) \
You can find it here

Her mind is Tiffany-twisted \
She got the Mercedes-Benz \
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys \
That she calls friends

How they dance in the courtyard \
Sweet summer sweat \
Some dance to remember \
Some dance to forget

So I called up the captain \
Please, bring me my wine \
He said: We haven't had that spirit here since \
Nineteen sixty-nine

And, still, those voices are calling from far away \
Wake you up in the middle of the night \
Just to hear them say

Welcome to the Hotel California \
Such a lovely place \
(Such a lovely place) \
Such a lovely face

They're livin' it up at the Hotel California \
What a nice surprise \
(What a nice surprise) \
Bring your alibis

Mirrors on the ceiling \
The pink champagne on ice \
And she said: We are all just prisoners here \
Of our own device \
And in the master's chambers \
They gathered for the feast \
They stab it with their steely knives \
But they just can't kill the beast

Last thing I remember \
I was running for the door \
I had to find the passage back \
To the place I was before \
Relax, said the night man \
We are programmed to receive \
You can check out any time you like \
But you can never leave

### Psycho Killer
#### Talking Heads

I can't seem to face up to the facts \
I'm tense and nervous and I can't relax \
I can't sleep 'cause my bed's on fire \
Don't touch me, I'm a real live wire

Psycho killer, qu'est-ce que c'est? \
Fa, fa, fa, fa, fa, fa, fa, fa, fa, far better \
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run away \
Oh, oh, oh \
Psycho killer, qu'est-ce que c'est? \
Fa, fa, fa, fa, fa, fa, fa, fa, fa, far better \
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run away \
Oh, oh, oh, oh, aye-ya-ya-ya-ya

You start a conversation, you can't even finish it \
You're talking a lot, but you're not saying anything \
When I have nothing to say, my lips are sealed \
Say something once, why say it again?

Psycho killer, qu'est-ce que c'est? \
Fa, fa, fa, fa, fa, fa, fa, fa, fa, far better \
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run away \
Oh, oh, oh \
Psycho killer, qu'est-ce que c'est? \
Fa, fa, fa, fa, fa, fa, fa, fa, fa, far better \
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run away \
Oh, oh, oh, oh, aye-ya-ya-ya-ya

Ce que j'ai fait, ce soir-là \
Ce qu'elle a dit, ce soir-là \
Réalisant mon espoir \
Je me lance, vers la gloire, okay \
Aye-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya \
We are vain and we are blind \
I hate people when they're not polite

Psycho killer, qu'est-ce que c'est? \
Fa, fa, fa, fa, fa, fa, fa, fa, fa, far better \
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run away \
Oh, oh, oh \
Psycho killer, qu'est-ce que c'est? \
Fa, fa, fa, fa, fa, fa, fa, fa, fa, far better \
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run away \

### Wish You Were Here
#### Pink Floyd

So, so you think you can tell \
Heaven from hell? \
Blue skies from pain? \
Can you tell a green field \
From a cold steel rail? \
A smile from a veil? \
Do you think you can tell?

Did they get you to trade \
Your heroes for ghosts? \
Hot ashes for trees? \
Hot air for a cool breeze? \
Cold comfort for change? \
Did you exchange \
A walk on part in the war \
For a lead role in a cage?

How I wish \
How I wish you were here \
We're just two lost souls \
Swimming in a fish bowl year after year \
Running over the same old ground \
What have we found? \
The same old fears \
Wish you were here

### Agora Só Falta Você
#### Rita Lee

Um belo dia resolvi mudar \
E fazer tudo o que eu queria fazer \
Me libertei daquela vida vulgar \
Que eu levava estando junto a você \
E em tudo que eu faço \
Existe um porquê \
Eu sei que eu nasci \
Sei que eu nasci pra saber

E fui andando sem pensar em voltar \
E sem ligar pro que me aconteceu \
Um belo dia vou lhe telefonar \
Pra lhe dizer que aquele sonho cresceu \
No ar que eu respiro \
Eu sinto prazer \
De ser quem eu sou \ 
De estar onde estou \
Agora só falta você

(Solo - instrumental da 2a parte)

Um belo dia resolvi mudar \

Sei que eu nasci pra saber \
Saber o que \
E fui andando sem pensar em voltar \

### Malandragem
#### Cássia Eller

Quem sabe eu ainda sou uma garotinha \
Esperando o ônibus da escola, sozinha \
Cansada com minhas meias três quartos \
Rezando baixo pelos cantos \
Por ser uma menina má

Quem sabe o príncipe virou um chato \
Que vive dando no meu saco \
Quem sabe a vida é não sonhar

Eu só peço a Deus \
Um pouco de malandragem \
Pois sou criança \
E não conheço a verdade \
Eu sou poeta e não aprendi a amar \
Eu sou poeta e não aprendi a amar

Bobeira é não viver a realidade \
E eu ainda tenho uma tarde inteira \
Eu ando nas ruas \
Eu troco um cheque \
Mudo uma planta de lugar \
Dirijo meu carro \
Tomo o meu pileque \
E ainda tenho tempo pra cantar

Eu só peço a Deus \
Um pouco de malandragem \
Pois sou criança \
E não conheço a verdade \
Eu sou poeta e não aprendi a amar \
Eu sou poeta e não aprendi a amar

Eu ando nas ruas \
Eu troco um cheque \
Mudo uma planta de lugar \
Dirijo meu carro \
Tomo o meu pileque \
E ainda tenho tempo pra cantar

Eu só peço a Deus \
Um pouco de malandragem \
Pois sou criança \
E não conheço a verdade \
Eu sou poeta e não aprendi a amar \
Eu sou poeta e não aprendi a amar \
(Repete 3x)

Quem sabe eu ainda sou uma garotinha!

### Blues da Piedade
#### Cazuza

Agora eu vou cantar pros miseráveis \
Que vagam pelo mundo derrotados \
Pra essas sementes mal plantadas \
Que já nascem com cara de abortadas \
Pras pessoas de alma bem pequena \
Remoendo pequenos problemas \
Querendo sempre aquilo que não têm

Pra quem vê a luz \
Mas não ilumina suas minicertezas \
Vive contando dinheiro \
E não muda quando é Lua cheia \
Pra quem não sabe amar \
Fica esperando \
Alguém que caiba no seu sonho \
Como varizes que vão aumentando \
Como insetos em volta da lâmpada

Vamos pedir piedade (Ahhhh ahh ah ah ah ahhh) \
Senhor, piedade (Ahhhh ahh ah ah ah ahhh) \
Pra essa gente careta e covarde (ah) \
Vamos pedir piedade \
Senhor, piedade  (Senhor! Piedade!) \
Lhes dê grandeza e um pouco de coragem

Quero cantar só pras pessoas fracas \
Que tão no mundo e perderam a viagem \
Quero cantar o blues \
Com o pastor e o bumbo na praça \
Vamos pedir piedade \
Pois há um incêndio sob a chuva rala \
Somos iguais em desgraça \
Vamos cantar o blues da piedade

Vamos pedir piedade (Ahhhh ahh ah ah ah ahhh) \
Senhor, piedade (Ahhhh ahh ah ah ah ahhh) \
Pra essa gente careta e covarde (ah) \
Vamos pedir piedade \
Senhor, piedade  (Senhor! Piedade!) \
Lhes dê grandeza e um pouco de coragem \
Pra quem não sabe amar \
Fica esperando \
Alguém que caiba no seu sonho \
Como varizes que vão aumentando \
Como insetos em volta da lâmpada 

Vamos pedir piedade (Ahhhh ahh ah ah ah ahhh) \
Senhor, piedade (Ahhhh ahh ah ah ah ahhh) \
Pra essa gente careta e covarde (ah) \
Vamos pedir piedade \
Senhor, piedade  (Senhor! Piedade!) \
Lhes dê um pouco de coragem

Ah, ah, um pouco de coragem \
Ah, ah, lhes dê grandeza e um pouco de coragem

### Dream On
#### Aerosmith

Every time that I look in the mirror \
All these lines on my face getting clearer \
The past is gone \
It went by like dusk to dawn \
Isn't that the way? \
Everybody's got the dues in life to pay, yeah

I know nobody knows \
Where it comes and where it goes \
I know it's everybody's sin \
You've got to lose to know how to win

Half my life's in books' written pages \
Live and learn from fools and from sages \
You know it's true, oh \
All the things come back to you

Sing with me, sing for the year \
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear \
Sing with me, if it's just for today \
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

Yeah, sing with me, sing for the year \
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear \
Sing with me, if it's just for today \
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

Dream on, dream on, dream on \
Dream until the dream come true \
Dream on, dream on, dream on \
Dream until your dream come true \
Dream on, dream on, dream on \
Dream on, dream on, dream on \
Dream on, oh

Sing with me, sing for the year \
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear \
Sing with me, if it's just for today \
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

Sing with me, sing for the year \
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear \
Sing with me, if it's just for today \
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

### Heaven
#### Bryan Adams

Oh, thinking about our younger years \
There was only you and me \
We were young and wild and free

Now nothing can take you away from me \
We've been down that road before \
But that's over now \
You keep me coming back for more

Baby, you're all that I want \
When you're lying here in my arms \
I'm finding it hard to believe \
We're in heaven

And love is all that I need \
And I found it there in your heart \
It isn't too hard to see \
We're in heaven

Oh, once in your life you find someone \
Who will turn your world around \
Bring you up when you're feeling down

Yeah, nothing could change what you mean to me \
Oh, there's lots that I could say \
But just hold me now \
'Cause our love will light the way

And baby you're all that I want \
When you're lying here in my arms \
I'm finding it hard to believe \
We're in heaven

Yeah, love is all that I need \
And I found it there in your heart \
It isn't too hard to see \
We're in heaven \
Yeah

I've been waiting for so long \
For something to arrive \
For love to come along

Now our dreams are coming true \
Through the good times and the bad \
Yeah, I'll be standing there by you, oh

And baby you're all that I want \
When you're lying here in my arms \
I'm finding it hard to believe \
We're in heaven

And love is all that I need \
And I found it there in your heart \
It isn't too hard to see \
We're in heaven, heaven, woah

You're all that I want \
You're all that I need

Que arrefece

Simples e suave coisa \
Suave coisa nenhuma \

### Fátima
#### Capital Inicial

Vocês esperam uma intervenção divina \
Mas não sabem que o tempo agora está contra vocês \
Vocês se perdem no meio de tanto medo \
De não conseguir dinheiro pra comprar sem se vender \
E vocês armam seus esquemas ilusórios \
Continuam só fingindo que o mundo ninguém fez \
Mas acontece que tudo tem começo \
E se começa um dia acaba, eu tenho pena de vocês

E as ameaças de ataque nuclear \
Bombas de nêutrons não foi Deus quem fez \
Alguém, alguém um dia vai se vingar \
Vocês são vermes, pensam que são reis \
Não quero ser como vocês \
Eu não preciso mais \
Eu já sei o que eu tenho que saber \
E agora tanto faz

Três crianças sem dinheiro e sem moral \
Não ouviram a voz suave que era uma lágrima \
E se esqueceram de avisar pra todo mundo \
Ela talvez tivesse um nome e era: Fátima \
E de repente o vinho virou água \
E a ferida não cicatrizou \
E o limpo se sujou \
E no terceiro dia ninguém ressuscitou

### I Don't Wanna Lose You

Oh \
Oh, oh

Women of a certain age \
They learn to rely and judge all his responses \
Having played the mating game \
She doesn't waste time 'cause all that she wants is \
Really and honest emotions \
Ones he can't help but show \
Though I hardly know your name \
I know about love and I know

I don't wanna lose you \
I don't even wanna say goodbye, oh, no \
I just wanna hold on to this \
True love, true love

Women who have made mistakes \
Are a little afraid \
They don't like taking chances \
She will play the waiting game \
She's never impressed by those manly advances \
I know I've only just met you \
Baby, I should know better \
But when you look at me that way \
There's something inside that's so right

I don't wanna lose you \
I don't even wanna say goodbye, oh, no \

All my friends are heathens, take it slow \
Wait for them to ask you who you know \
Please, don't make any sudden moves \
You don't know the half of the abuse

All my friends are heathens, take it slow \
Wait for them to ask you who you know \
Please, don't make any sudden moves \
You don't know the half of the abuse

Welcome to the room of people \
Who have rooms of people that they loved one day \
Docked away \
Just because we check the guns at the door \
Doesn't mean our brains will change from hand grenades

You'll never know the psychopath sitting next to you \
You'll never know the murderer sitting next to you \
You'll think: How'd I get here, sitting next to you? \
But after all I've said, please, don't forget

All my friends are heathens, take it slow \
Wait for them to ask you who you know \
Please, don't make any sudden moves \
You don't know the half of the abuse

We don't deal with outsiders very well \
They say newcomers have a certain smell \
You have trust issues, not to mention \
They say they can smell your intentions

You'll never know the freak show sitting next to you \
You'll have some weird people sitting next to you \
You'll think: How did I get here, sitting next to you? \
But after all I've said, please, don't forget

(Watch it) \
(Watch it)

All my friends are heathens, take it slow \
Wait for them to ask you who you know \
Please, don't make any sudden moves \
You don't know the half of the abuse

All my friends are heathens, take it slow \

Wait for them to ask you who you know \
(Watch it) \
Please, all my friends are heathens, take it slow \
(Watch it) \
Wait for them to ask you who you know

Why'd you come? You knew you should have stayed \
(It's blasphemy) \
I tried to warn you just to stay away \
And now they're outside ready to bust \
It looks like you might be one of us

### Rock You Like a Hurricane
#### Scorpions

It's early morning, the sun comes out \
Last night was shaking and pretty loud \
My cat is purring, it scratches my skin \
So what is wrong with another sin? \
The bitch is hungry, she needs to tell \
So give her inches and feed her well \
More days to come, new places to go \
I've got to leave, it's time for a show

Here I am \
Rock you like a hurricane \
Here I am \
Rock you like a hurricane 

My body is burning, it starts to shout \
Desire is coming, it breaks out loud \
Lust is in cages 'til storm breaks loose \
Just have to make it with someone I choose \
The night is calling, I have to go \
The wolf is hungry, he runs the show \
He's licking his lips, he's ready to win \
On the hunt tonight for love at first sting 

Here I am \
Rock you like a hurricane \
Here I am \
Rock you like a hurricane

Here I am \
Rock you like a hurricane \
Here I am \
Rock you like a hurricane

Rock you like a hurricane

It's early morning, the sun comes out \
Last night was shaking and pretty loud \
My cat is purring, it scratches my skin \
So what is wrong with another sin? \
The night is calling, I have to go \
The wolf is hungry, he runs the show \
He's licking his lips, he's ready to win \
On the hunt tonight for love at first sting

Here I am \

Rock you like a hurricane \
